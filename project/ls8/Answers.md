* In industry terms, how many months does it take for the number of transistors
  on a chip to double? Approximately every two years.

* Why are registers necessary? Why not use RAM?
Registers are placed in CPU, which makes transmission more efficient, and signals are passed after storing them in catche.

* Why is cache useful?

* Why are interrupts useful?

* What are some examples of interrupts that might occur?

* Describe what the system bus is and what size it is.

* Describe what a CPU instruction is.

* Describe what the CPU clock represents.

* Describe what a CPU interrupt is.

* Describe what kinds of pins enter and exit the CPU.

* Describe what DMA is.

* Say which peripherals are connected to the DMA bus.

* Say which peripherals are connected to the I/O bus.

* Describe what L1, L2, and L3 caches are.

* Describe caching and storage from L1 through cloud storage.
